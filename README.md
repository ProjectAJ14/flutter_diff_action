üéØ Run Flutter commands on changed files with style! ‚≠ê

Originally created by [Ajay Kumar] & [Dipangshu Roy]

## Overview

This action runs Flutter commands (test, analyze, format) only on changed files in your project. It supports both standard Flutter projects and Melos-based mono-repos. The action is smart enough to:

- Run tests for changed files and their corresponding test files
- Handle format and analyze commands for changed files
- Support Melos workspaces for mono-repo setups
- Work with both Pull Requests and direct pushes

## Usage

### Basic Flutter Project

```yaml
steps:
  - name: Clone repository
    uses: actions/checkout@v4
  - name: Set up Flutter
    uses: subosito/flutter-action@v2
    with:
      flutter-version: 3.19.6

  - name: Run Flutter command
    uses: ProjectAJ14/flutter_diff_action@v1
    with:
      command: "flutter test"
      use-melos: false
```

```yaml
steps:
  - name: Clone repository
    uses: actions/checkout@v4

  - name: Run Flutter command
